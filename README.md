# phpDVDProfiler

The phpDVDProfiler project allows you to display on the web your DVD collection maintained with Invelos's DVDProfiler software.

Alas, the project seems to have been dead for some time and has stopped working with newer versions of PHP. So for my own needs, I've decided to make it work again with PHP 7.2, and publish it too so that others can benefit if they need it. I have no intention on making more work than basic maintenance to support newer versions of PHP.

## Getting Started

See the file phpdvdprofiler-install.txt for instructions on installing the application.

No idea what the original license was (couldn't find it in the code). At least the gallery code from Thomas Fintzel allows any modification / redistribution / etc. as long as the copyright is there. As for my own modifications and contributions, do whatever you like with them.
