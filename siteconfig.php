// $force_cleanup set to true makes updates always rejig boxsets and re-populate the statistics

// $usetemptable will speed up statistics calculation on updates. It requires that the mysql user

// New (3.7.2.2) update mechanism
//
// New in this release, the update code uses a bunch of JavaScript to try to automate the
// update process. If your update normally completes without incident, then this should
// be completely transparent to you.
// The new mechanism tries to address the problem of updates dying before the update is
// complete. The previous mechanism required the user to notice that the update had died,
// and then re-run the update, possibly changing some parameters. The new update mechanism
// automates that process, watching to see if the update died, and automatically running
// another with the parameters set correctly. This may run for a long time, but as long
// as you don't close your browser it should eventually finish (it shouldn't take very
// much longer than the previous mechanism, in fact).

// There are a number of tunable variables introduced, which should be fine with their
// default values.
//
// $SubmitOldStyle - defaults to false. If set to true, then the old mechanism is used to update
// $UpdateDebug - defaults to false. If set to true, it puts a debug button on the UI and makes
//                the JavaScript code instrument the update run. When the debug button is pressed,
//                the output of the code is written into a window where it can be copy 'n pasted
//                into an email to me for debugging.
// $UpdateStatusFrequency - defaults to 3 (seconds). This is the frequency with which the code
//                checks to see how the update is progressing. It causes a db call on the server,
//                so the smaller you make this the harder the code presses your server.
// $UpdateMillisecondPauseBetweenPosts - defaults to 100 (milliseconds). You should not have to
//                change this. It is the amount of time that the program waits before issuing a
//                new update request. It may cause no preformance change with your server. Setting
//                it low may annoy your ISP.
// $UpdateMillisecondSettlingTime - default is 2000 (milliseconds - 2 seconds) This should not need
//                to be changed. It is the amount of time that the code waits for possibly in-flight
//                data to be returned from the server. Setting it too low could result in some very
//                odd effects on the display. This time is most noticable as the brief pause once
//                the program has determined that the current update has stopped running. If the value
//                is too low, then results could arrive unexpectedly, making the program think that
//                an error has occurred when it has not. This would not be a fatal problem.

// This variable changes the mechanism used to update actors names in the db when importing
// the XML data. This operation is quite slow. Setting this variable attempts to make it
// faster, by reading the entire table into memory at the beginning, working out of the
// memory table while processing the XML, and then writing the changes back into the DB
// after it is finished. Depending on the number of unique actors/crew, this can consume
// rather a lot of memory for the table. Possibly enough to blow the program up. But it
// much faster when putting in many actors, and it doesn't beat the database up nearly as
// much as the alternative. If there are only a small number of profiles changing, this
// mechanism can make the update slower. Changable in localsiteconfig.php, as always, and
// it might be something to change depending on the character of the update ...
// NOTE: the new automatic update ignores this value: it always starts out with this set
// to true, and if it determines that the update is failing consistantly, then it resets
// it to false for further attempts.

// The Javascript menu must be customized in-line. The code is in index.php; search for the string "mom"

// Display of small mediatype icons in menu listing
// Choices are:
//   0 - Display Icons on every line
//   1 - Display only icons that are HiDef (Bluray, HD DVD and combos with those)
//   2 - Don't Display Icons

// One can change the images used by adding an entry such as:
//$MediaTypes[MEDIA_TYPE_BLURAY]['FormatIcon'] = 'gfx/NewBlurayImage.png';
//*********** Note that this has changed recently. The above is the new way to do it.
// The images need to be quite small, so it's best to test

// In the Windows program, new user-defined collections can be set to show up in the owned list or not.
// That information is not available in the XML file. By default, we show user-defined collections in the
// owned list. For Collections that you wish to not appear there, add their names to the $CollectionsNotInOwned
// array. Like so:
// $CollectionsNotInOwned[] = 'My Collection Name';
// You can add as many as you like. Note that after changing this value you must update your collection.
//
// The program supports Custom media types without intervention. If you want to have custom banners,
// or icons, or a custom formaticon, just add a line for each Custom Media Type like this:
//$MediaTypes['ExactNameOfCustomMediaType'] = array('FormatIcon' => 'FormatIconImageFile', 'Icon' => 'IconImageFile', 'Banner' => 'BannerImagefile');
// so for example:
//$MediaTypes['MP4 File'] = array('FormatIcon' => 'mp4.png', 'Icon' => 'big_mp4.jpg', 'Banner' => 'mp4file.png');
// Note that Banners *must* be png files

// Add mediatype banner on generated thumbnails.
// If you change this value, you'll have to do a full update of your collection, and then remove every image in the imagecache folder.
// Choices are:
//   0 - Adhere to the DVDProfiler way (mostly: banner on HD formats)
//   1 - Always add a media banner to thumbnails
//   2 - Don't add a media banner to thumbnails
$AddBannerOnThumbnails = 0;
