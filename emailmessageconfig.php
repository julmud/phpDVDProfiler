//$LOAN_REMINDER_FROM = "fred@bws.com";

// This file also needs to define the messages that will be sent to the borrowers. If you want
// only one message sent until the DVD is returned, then define only $message[1]. If you want
// a series of different messages sent until the return, then define more messages as
// $message[1], $message[2], $message[3], etc. The program sends $message[1], next it sends
// $message[2], etc. until it reaches the end, and then it continues to send the last message.

// The same thing applies to the subjects of the sent messages, using $subject[1], etc. The number
// of different subjects need not match the number of different messages.

// The messages and subjects may use some special variables to allow personalisation:
// $LOAN_TO		- The borrower's name (from DVDProfiler)
// $LOAN_TITLE		- The title of the borrowed DVD
// $LOAN_QUOTED_TITLE	- The title of the DVD in quotes
// $LOAN_DATE_BORROWED	- The date the DVD was borrowed (from DVDProfiler)
// $LOAN_DATE_DUE	- The date the DVD was due to be returned (from DVDProfiler)
// $LOAN_GRACE		- The grace period before any email reminders are sent (in days)
// $LOAN_WARNING_INTERVAL - The frequency with which email warnings are sent (in days)
// $LOAN_REMINDER_TO	- The email address where the reminder is being sent (from DVDProfiler)
// $LOAN_WARNING_NUMBER	- The number of the current warning (is the message number to be sent)
// $NOW			- The current date

Hi $LOAN_TO,
	You've had $LOAN_QUOTED_TITLE since $LOAN_DATE_BORROWED. It was due back on $LOAN_DATE_DUE. It'd be great to get it back. I'll send another note in $LOAN_WARNING_INTERVAL days.

Cheers!

Hi $LOAN_TO,
	You've had $LOAN_QUOTED_TITLE since $LOAN_DATE_BORROWED. It was due back on $LOAN_DATE_DUE. I thought I'd wait $LOAN_GRACE days before mentioning it. It'd be great to get it back. I'll send another note in $LOAN_WARNING_INTERVAL days.

Cheers!

Good Day,
	You've had $LOAN_QUOTED_TITLE since $LOAN_DATE_BORROWED. It was due back on $LOAN_DATE_DUE and it's now $NOW. It'd _really_ be great to get it back. Soon, please. I'll send another note in $LOAN_WARNING_INTERVAL days in case you missed my point.

Cheers!

Hey Butt-Nugget,
	You've had $LOAN_QUOTED_TITLE since $LOAN_DATE_BORROWED. You said you'd return it by $LOAN_DATE_DUE and it's now $NOW!!! I'm sending over Guido and Nunzio, the broken-nose twins to extract the DVD from your miserable carcass!!!

Have a great day

Fred
