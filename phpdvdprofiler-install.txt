phpDVDprofiler

The original implementation of phpDVDprofiler was written by Soenke J. Peters
(peters [at] opcenter [dot] de) and can be found at:
	http://www.opcenter.de/awf/index.php?id=59

This version has been extensively modified since the original release, primarily
by Fred Whiteside (fred [at] bws [dot] com) based on code and suggestions from
a wide variety of respondents. This document is based on a document created by
Andrea Whitlock (andrea [at] mobius-soft [dot] com).

	This software requires the following:
		1) a webserver
		2) something that will process PHP scripts
		3) a MySQL database (others may work; contact me for assistance)

Specifically, this software needs an installation of PHP which has php-xml
installed and with the mysqli extensions. The software should work with almost
any version of MySQL, although it is tested primarily on my system, which has MariaDB 10.10.2.

The following PHP extensions are needed:
  * mysqli
  * mbstring
  * intl
  * gd2 (optional, used to resize the covers and generate thumbnails)

All of the things which require configuration are in the file siteconfig.php,
which is extensively documented regarding what the available options are.
The software tries to determine if the environment is set up correctly by
examining the schema, and printing messages if it has problems. The most
common problem is that the schema in the database doesn't match the schema
the program expects. The shell command:
$ mysql -u root -p phpdvdprofiler < schema.sql
will cause the schema to be updated to the correct values. This is detailed
further below.

To make it easier to apply updates to the software, a new file has been
added to the configuration: localsiteconfig.php. This file overrides the
values set in siteconfig.php. The intended usage is that one makes a copy
of siteconfig.php, named localsiteconfig.php. Then you make any changes to
suit your site in localsiteconfig.php. When a new release is made, the
distribution will contain a new siteconfig.php which can then safely over-
write the old siteconfig.php. Distributions will not contain a file named
localsiteconfig.php, so it won't be overwritten. You can inspect any new
features in siteconfig.php, making any changes to the provided defaults
in localsiteconfig.php. This also means that you can safely change the
names of the db, accounts, and passwords, and not worry about the new
version breaking everything :)

	There are several possible URLs that can be used. The one most people
will use is http://your.site/your/path/index.php which starts running the
program and displays the DVDs. If one runs index.php?action=update then the
program attempts to import your collection into the database (after checking
some passwords). The other major URL is index.php?action=userpref which will
bring up a page wherein users can configure some parts of the UI for themselves.
This last section uses cookies to remember preferences, and if cookies are
shut off, then the user will be stuck with the site default values.

Here are some installation notes from Andrea Whitlock (edited for the current
details of the installation)
================================================================================

I'm running apache 2.0.47, php 4.3.2, and mysql 4.0.15.  My web server runs
as the user apache in the group apache.  I installed phpdvdprofiler in my
~/public_html directory.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

cd ~/public_html
unzip -a phpDVDprofiler-v20050102.zip

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Edit siteconfig.php and configure $dbuser, $dbpasswd, $update_login, $update_pass.
I set my $dbuser to 'guest'.  The $update vars are the login name and password
that you need to type in on the web page form when you try to update your
collection.  Set these to whatever you'd like.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Change permissions on files so apache can read them.
Remember to also give execute permissions on the directories.  After you setup
siteconfig.php, you might want to make apache own the file and have no one else
with permissions on it, so no one on your system can look at your settings in
the file (database user names, passwords, web page logins, etc.).

Change group on images/thumbnails to apache and make it group writeable
(everyone else has read and execute permissions on it).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Export dvdprofiler collection to DVDAll.xml (on your PC) and transfer
DVDAll.xml to your web server into ~/public_html/phpdvdprofiler. You can use
whatever name you like rather than DVDAll.xml; it is configured in siteconfig.php

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Transfer copies of all jpg files in
C:\Program Files\InterVocative Software\DVD Profiler\IMAGES to
~/public_html/phpdvdprofiler/images.

Transfer copies of all jpg files in
C:\Program Files\InterVocative Software\DVD Profiler\IMAGES\THUMBNAILS to
~/public_html/phpdvdprofiler/images/thumbnails.

Don't forget to CHMOD the image files so that the Apache user can read them.

Here is some DVD Profiler trivia. You might notice that there is an IMAGES
directory and an IMAGES\THUMBNAILS directory for DVD Profiler.  And some
pictures are not in the THUMBNAILS directory.  The thumbnails are created
when you run a report that displays thumbnails.  If you have not run a recent
report that uses thumbnails and have entered in new DVDs, there will only be
pictures for the new DVDs in the IMAGES directory and not in the THUMBNAILS
directory.  You should run a report (I recommend the IVS Classic DVD Listing
report with Options set to "Standard (show all records, sort by title)") to
refresh all the pictures in THUMBNAILS and then copy the files
from C:\Program Files\InterVocative Software\DVD Profiler\IMAGES\THUMBNAILS
to your web server (~/public_html/phpdvdprofiler/images/thumbnails).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I set $dbuser to guest in siteconfig.php, so I did the following commands to
create a mysql database called phpdvdprofiler for the user guest.

$ mysqladmin -u root -p create phpdvdprofiler
$ mysql -u root -p phpdvdprofiler < schema.sql
$ mysql -u root -p phpdvdprofiler
mysql> grant select,insert,update,delete on phpdvdprofiler.* to 'guest@localhost';

Note: After ugrading to mysql version 4.0.20, I had to change the above grant
statement to NOT use quotes:

mysql> grant select,insert,update,delete on phpdvdprofiler.* to guest@localhost;

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Next, run the webpage (adjust the url to match your setup):
http://yoursite/phpdvdprofiler/index.php?action=update
Alternatively, you can run the import from a command-line (for those who like
to set up scripts to automagically do things):
$ php index.php action=update
